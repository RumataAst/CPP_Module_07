# CPP Module 07 - Working with Templates

## Overview
This module introduces **templates** in C++, focusing on creating and using generic classes and functions.

## Key Topics
- **Function Templates**: Writing generic functions that work with any data type.
- **Class Templates**: Creating classes that can handle different data types without duplication.
- **Template Specialization**: Providing specific implementations for certain types.
- **Non-type Template Parameters**: Using constant values as template arguments.

## Notes
-  I cannot split the declaration and definition of template functions between a .hpp and .cpp.
-  Templates are compiled at the point of instantiation, the definition needs to be visible to the compiler whenever the template is instantiated.
